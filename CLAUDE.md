# Kaffah — Project-Specific Instructions

## Vision & Product Concept

**Mission:** Help Muslims follow the whole Quran by making them aware of what the Quran says to do (Hizb Allah) and what to avoid (Hizb al-Shaytan), with a primary score of "overall what percentage are you following the Quran?"

### Core Framework

**Implementation/Learning Levels** (who must act):
- Level 1 — Save yourself (فرض عين): *عليكم أنفسكم*
- Level 2 — Save yourself and family (فرض عين): *قوا أنفسكم وأهليكم نارًا*
- Level 3 — Save humanity (فرض كفاية / recommended): *ليظهره على الدين كله* / *كنتم خير أمة أخرجت للناس*

**Difficulty Levels:**
- Level 1 — Islam (5 pillars)
- Level 2 — Eemaan (6 articles of faith, تزكية)
- Level 3 — Ihsan (excellence in worship)

### The Four Packages (Pricing/Awareness Tiers)

**Hizb Allah — People of Jannah:**
- 🌿 Standard Jannah (Ashaab al-Yameen / أصحاب الميمنة) — Iman: doing obligatory deeds, avoiding kabair
- ✨ Premium Jannah (Sabiqoon / السابقون المقربون) — Ihsan: siddiqeen, shuhadaa, the mukhliseen who attain Jannat al-Firdous

**Hizb al-Shaytan — People of Hellfire:**
- 🔥 Standard Hellfire (Ashaab al-Shimaal / أصحاب الشمال) — Mushrikeen, Kafiroon, Zalimoon (30 major sins, Imam Dhahabi)
- ⛓ Worst Hellfire (Asfal al-Safileen / أسفل سافلين, الدرك الأسفل) — Munafiqeen, those who do Ria (Al-Ma'oon), those who deceive Allah and believers

### Roadmap

**Alpha (current):** Awareness MVP
- Quiz by Surah (last 10 surahs 105-114): verse identification, completion, action classification, translation matching
- Major Sins Quiz: 150 Qs from 30 major sins (Imam Dhahabi, Quran-focused)
- Major Sins Learning: card-per-sin with verses, explanation, capital punishment accordion
- Marketing landing page with the four Jannah/Hellfire packages

**Beta (next phase):** Local Communities
- Invite-only communities (Masjids, families, academies, e.g. Masjid Omeriye Nicosia, Masjid al-Nabawi, Constantinou family, Hidaya Academy)
- Leaderboard: "Aware people" (ref: 39:9) vs "Implementing people"
- Onboarding: personal info → major sins vulnerability score → good deeds score → overall Quran-following %

**Full Release:** Whole Quran coverage across all implementation/difficulty levels

### Key Quran References
- Awareness: *هَلْ يَسْتَوِي الَّذِينَ يَعْلَمُونَ وَالَّذِينَ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ* (39:9)
- Firdous inheritance: *الَّذِينَ يَرِثُونَ الْفِرْدَوْسَ* (23:10-11)
- Hellfire lowest pit: *إِنَّ الْمُنَافِقِينَ فِي الدَّرْكِ الْأَسْفَلِ* (4:145)
- Hizb Allah/Shaytan: *أُولَٰئِكَ حِزْبُ اللَّهِ* (58:22), *أُولَٰئِكَ حِزْبُ الشَّيْطَانِ* (58:19)

## Environment

- PHP binary: `/Users/waqasahmed/Library/Application Support/Herd/bin/php`
- Always prefix PHP commands: `export PATH="/Users/waqasahmed/Library/Application Support/Herd/bin:$PATH" && php artisan ...`
- Node/npm via nvm: `/Users/waqasahmed/.nvm/versions/node/v22.22.1/bin`
- App served by Herd at `https://kaffah.test`
- Database: SQLite at `database/database.sqlite`

## Common Commands

```bash
# Always prefix with PATH export in one-liners
export PATH="/Users/waqasahmed/Library/Application Support/Herd/bin:$PATH"

php artisan migrate:fresh --seed    # Reset + seed DB
php artisan test --compact          # Run all tests
vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent  # Format changed PHP files
npm run build                       # Build frontend assets
```

## Architecture Decisions

- **No auth package (MVP)**: No Breeze/Jetstream. Do NOT use `middleware('auth')` on any route — there is no `login` named route, so it throws `RouteNotFoundException`. Handle guests by checking `$request->user()` nullable in controllers.
- **Guest-friendly quizzes**: `user_id` is nullable on `quiz_attempts`; `authorize(): true` on all Form Requests.
- **Quiz flow**: `POST /quiz/{surah}/start` → redirects to `GET /quiz/attempt/{id}` (play page). Never render `Quiz/Play` from a POST — always redirect to the GET play route to avoid `MethodNotAllowedHttpException` on answer submission.
- **Flash data sharing**: `answerResult` is shared via `HandleInertiaRequests::share()` under `flash.answerResult`.
- **Models use `#[Fillable]` attribute** (not `$fillable` property) — see existing models for pattern.
- **JSON casts**: `question_data`, `selected_answer`, `question_ids`, `gender`, `age_group`, `action_categories` are all cast as `'array'` on their respective models.
- **Migration ordering**: Migrations for the same timestamp sort alphabetically — rename files with sequential suffixes (`031319`, `031321`, etc.) to control FK dependency order.
- **Test setup**: Feature tests that render Inertia pages must call `$this->withoutVite()` in `beforeEach`. Unit tests cannot use `$this->seed()` — move them to `tests/Feature/` instead.

## Data

- `database/data/surah_{105-114}.json` — primary verse/action data source; read by `SurahSeeder`
- 10 surahs, 48 verses, 188 quiz questions seeded
- Quiz question types: `verse_identification`, `verse_completion`, `action_classification`, `translation_matching`
- `implementation`: mixed quiz (all types) — not a standalone question type in the seeder

## Key Files

- `app/Services/QuizGeneratorService.php` — quiz selection + scoring logic
- `app/Http/Middleware/HandleInertiaRequests.php` — shared Inertia props (auth, flash)
- `database/seeders/SurahSeeder.php` + `QuizQuestionSeeder.php` — data pipeline
- `resources/css/app.css` — Tailwind v4 `@theme inline` with `--font-arabic: 'Amiri', serif`
- `resources/views/app.blade.php` — Amiri Google Font link

## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

- `wayfinder-development` — Activates whenever referencing backend routes in frontend components. Use when importing from @/actions or @/routes, calling Laravel routes from TypeScript, or working with Wayfinder route functions.
- `pest-testing` — Use this skill for Pest PHP testing in Laravel projects only. Trigger whenever any test is being written, edited, fixed, or refactored — including fixing tests that broke after a code change, adding assertions, converting PHPUnit to Pest, adding datasets, and TDD workflows. Always activate when the user asks how to write something in Pest, mentions test files or directories (tests/Feature, tests/Unit, tests/Browser), or needs browser testing, smoke testing multiple pages for JS errors, or architecture tests. Covers: it()/expect() syntax, datasets, mocking, browser testing (visit/click/fill), smoke testing, arch(), Livewire component tests, RefreshDatabase, and all Pest 4 features. Do not use for factories, seeders, migrations, controllers, models, or non-test PHP code.
- `inertia-vue-development` — Develops Inertia.js v2 Vue client-side applications. Activates when creating Vue pages, forms, or navigation; using <Link>, <Form>, useForm, or router; working with deferred props, prefetching, or polling; or when user mentions Vue with Inertia, Vue pages, Vue forms, or Vue navigation.
- `tailwindcss-development` — Always invoke when the user's message includes 'tailwind' in any form. Also invoke for: building responsive grid layouts (multi-column card grids, product grids), flex/grid page structures (dashboards with sidebars, fixed topbars, mobile-toggle navs), styling UI components (cards, tables, navbars, pricing sections, forms, inputs, badges), adding dark mode variants, fixing spacing or typography, and Tailwind v3/v4 work. The core use case: writing or fixing Tailwind utility classes in HTML templates (Blade, JSX, Vue). Skip for backend PHP logic, database queries, API routes, JavaScript with no HTML/CSS component, CSS file audits, build tool configuration, and vanilla CSS.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server that comes with powerful tools designed specifically for this application. Use them.

## Artisan Commands

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `php artisan route:list`, `php artisan tinker --execute "..."`).
- Use `php artisan list` to discover available commands and `php artisan [command] --help` to check parameters.

## URLs

- Whenever you share a project URL with the user, you should use the `get-absolute-url` tool to ensure you're using the correct scheme, domain/IP, and port.

## Debugging

- Use the `database-query` tool when you only need to read from the database.
- Use the `database-schema` tool to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.
- To execute PHP code for debugging, run `php artisan tinker --execute "your code here"` directly.
- To read configuration values, read the config files directly or run `php artisan config:show [key]`.
- To inspect routes, run `php artisan route:list` directly.
- To check environment variables, read the `.env` file directly.

## Reading Browser Logs With the `browser-logs` Tool

- You can read browser logs, errors, and exceptions using the `browser-logs` tool from Boost.
- Only recent browser logs will be useful - ignore old logs.

## Searching Documentation (Critically Important)

- Boost comes with a powerful `search-docs` tool you should use before trying other approaches when working with Laravel or Laravel ecosystem packages. This tool automatically passes a list of installed packages and their versions to the remote Boost API, so it returns only version-specific documentation for the user's circumstance. You should pass an array of packages to filter on if you know you need docs for particular packages.
- Search the documentation before making code changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.
- Use multiple, broad, simple, topic-based queries at once. For example: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. The most relevant results will be returned first.
- Do not add package names to queries; package information is already shared. For example, use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Available Search Syntax

1. Simple Word Searches with auto-stemming - query=authentication - finds 'authenticate' and 'auth'.
2. Multiple Words (AND Logic) - query=rate limit - finds knowledge containing both "rate" AND "limit".
3. Quoted Phrases (Exact Position) - query="infinite scroll" - words must be adjacent and in that order.
4. Mixed Queries - query=middleware "rate limit" - "middleware" AND exact phrase "rate limit".
5. Multiple Queries - queries=["authentication", "middleware"] - ANY of these terms.

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.

## Constructors

- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion in `__construct()`.
    - `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`
- Do not allow empty `__construct()` methods with zero parameters unless the constructor is private.

## Type Declarations

- Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
- Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.

<!-- Explicit Return Types and Method Params -->
```php
protected function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool
{
    ...
}
```

## Enums

- Typically, keys in an Enum should be TitleCase. For example: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.

## Comments

- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Never use comments within the code itself unless the logic is exceptionally complex.

## PHPDoc Blocks

- Add useful array shape type definitions when appropriate.

=== herd rules ===

# Laravel Herd

- The application is served by Laravel Herd and will be available at: `https?://[kebab-case-project-dir].test`. Use the `get-absolute-url` tool to generate valid URLs for the user.
- You must not run any commands to make the site available via HTTP(S). It is always available through Laravel Herd.

=== inertia-laravel/core rules ===

# Inertia

- Inertia creates fully client-side rendered SPAs without modern SPA complexity, leveraging existing server-side patterns.
- Components live in `resources/js/pages` (unless specified in `vite.config.js`). Use `Inertia::render()` for server-side routing instead of Blade views.
- ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Inertia documentation and updated code examples.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `inertia-vue-development` when working with Inertia Vue client-side patterns.

# Inertia v2

- Use all Inertia features from v1 and v2. Check the documentation before making changes to ensure the correct approach.
- New features: deferred props, infinite scroll, merging props, polling, prefetching, once props, flash data.
- When using deferred props, add an empty state with a pulsing or animated skeleton.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using `php artisan list` and check their parameters with `php artisan [command] --help`.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

## Database

- Always use proper Eloquent relationship methods with return type hints. Prefer relationship methods over raw queries or manual joins.
- Use Eloquent models and relationships before suggesting raw database queries.
- Avoid `DB::`; prefer `Model::query()`. Generate code that leverages Laravel's ORM capabilities rather than bypassing them.
- Generate code that prevents N+1 query problems by using eager loading.
- Use Laravel's query builder for very complex database operations.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `php artisan make:model --help` to check the available options.

### APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## Controllers & Validation

- Always create Form Request classes for validation rather than inline validation in controllers. Include both validation rules and custom error messages.
- Check sibling Form Requests to see if the application uses array or string based validation rules.

## Authentication & Authorization

- Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features (gates, policies, Sanctum, etc.).

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Queues

- Use queued jobs for time-consuming operations with the `ShouldQueue` interface.

## Configuration

- Use environment variables only in configuration files - never use the `env()` function directly outside of config files. Always use `config('app.name')`, not `env('APP_NAME')`.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== wayfinder/core rules ===

# Laravel Wayfinder

Wayfinder generates TypeScript functions for Laravel routes. Import from `@/actions/` (controllers) or `@/routes/` (named routes).

- IMPORTANT: Activate `wayfinder-development` skill whenever referencing backend routes in frontend components.
- Invokable Controllers: `import StorePost from '@/actions/.../StorePostController'; StorePost()`.
- Parameter Binding: Detects route keys (`{post:slug}`) — `show({ slug: "my-post" })`.
- Query Merging: `show(1, { mergeQuery: { page: 2, sort: null } })` merges with current URL, `null` removes params.
- Inertia: Use `.form()` with `<Form>` component or `form.submit(store())` with useForm.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- If you have modified any PHP files, you must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest

- This project uses Pest for testing. Create tests: `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- Run tests: `php artisan test --compact` or filter: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName`.
- Do NOT delete tests without approval.

=== inertia-vue/core rules ===

# Inertia + Vue

Vue components must have a single root element.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `inertia-vue-development` when working with Inertia Vue client-side patterns.
